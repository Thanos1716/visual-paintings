### What is this?

This pack aims to give the armor trims unique textures in the GUI.

Below is a table of each of the new textures:

### How do I get it to work?

In order for you to get these wonderful textures, you can either use:

- [Fabulously Optimized](https://download.fo) (recommended)
- [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) or [[CIT] Custom Item Textures](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit)(manual installation)
- Any modpack including CIT Resewn, CIT or another working fork.
- [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) (untested)

### Chime?

In the future I may get around to working out how Chime works, but at the moment it's not supported.
If you feel inclined to add support, make sure to check out this pack's source first as it might help you build it.

If you have found a broken texture in this pack, or would like to request a feature, please raise an issue on the [issues](https://github.com/Thanos1716/visual-paintings/issues) page.

### Curseforge

I will not be hosting this pack on Curseforge due to a combination of no Linux support for Minecraft in the Curseforge launcher (despite both Minecraft and Curseforge having a Linux client), no option to create an account without linking other services, and the general state that Curseforge is in.

<strong>Due to the reasons outlined above and although the license permits it, I would appreciate it if you don't upload direct copies of this pack to Curseforge.</strong> Any derivatives of it however, go wild!
