## About

### What is this?

This pack aims to give the paintings unique textures in the GUI.

<strong>Be warned, this only works for the creative mode items without mods/datapacks!</strong>

Below is a table of each of the new textures:

### How do I get it to work?

In order for you to get these wonderful textures, you can either use:

- [Fabulously Optimized](https://download.fo) (recommended)
- [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) or [[CIT] Custom Item Textures](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit) (manual installation)
- Any modpack including CIT Resewn, CIT or another working fork.
- [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) (untested)

Neither Chime nor Polytone are supported at the moment.
